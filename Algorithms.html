        <h2>Chapter 5: Programming Algorithms & Software Testing</h2>
        <h3>Phases of computer program development:</h3>
        <ul>
            <ol>Phase 1: Understanding the Problems</ol>
            <ol>Phase 2: Design a algortihm to solve your problems</ol>
            <ol>Phase 3: Write your program code in appropiate language based on the algorithm you are using</ol>
            <ol>Phase 4: Enter your program and remeber to save it</ol>
            <ol>Phase 5: Execute the program</ol>
            <ol>Phase 6:Test your program and  find your errors and debug them and then restart the test</ol>
            <ol>Phase 7:Evaluate your programs</ol>
        </ul>
        <h3>Programming structures:</h3>
        <ul>
            <ol>Sequential structure:Top-down execution</ol>
            <ol>Decision structures: if/then/else</ol>
            <ol>Iterative (looping):
                <ul>
                    <li>While loop: continue to loop as long as something is true</li>
                    <li>repeat/until loop: continue to loop until something is true</li>
                    <li>for loop: loop your given number</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <ol>Recursive structures:
                <ul>
                    <ol>Repeat your set of instructions as a subtask of itself</ol>
                    <ol>repetition continues until:
                        <ul>
                            <li>degenerative case. which is a termination condition, is met</li>
                            <li>degenerative case is also called a base case</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>
                </ul>
            </ol>
        </ul>
        <h3>Two clasic programming or database problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <ol>Sorting: Descending order or Ascending order
                <ul>
                    <li>Sorting numbers</li>
                    <li>sorting strings in accordance with ASCII values</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <ol>Searching: find specific data that meet a certain criteria
                <ul>
                    <ol>In database:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Filters: temporary search</li>
                            <li>Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <ol>Two popular search techniques:
                <ul>
                    <ol>Sequential search: search from top  to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time</ol>
                    <ol>Binary search:
                        <ul>
                            <li>only works if data is sorted first</li>
                            <li>start in middle, then go to half of that, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>
                </ul>
            </ol>
        </ul>
        <h3>Two classic program goals:</h3>
        <ul>
            <ol>Efficiency: Program takes minimal time and/or resources</ol>
            <ol>Correctness: Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions</ol>
        </ul>
        <h3>Software testing and verification</h3>
        <ul>
            <ol>Kinds of tests:
                <ul>
                    <li>Acceptance testing: Verifies that the whole system works like it's supposed to and nothing is wrong</li>
                    <li>Integration testing: Makes sure that that the software components are working together</li>
                    <li>Unit testing: Making sure that every software unit does is working properly</li>
                    <li>Functional testing: Evaluates the functionality of an application  by testing its individual functions</li>
                    <li>Performance testing: Tests how the software operates from different types of  workloads</li>
                    <li>Stress testing: Tests to see how much it takes to make it fail. </li>
                    <li>Usability testing: Tests how easy it is for customer use</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <ol>Software testing is done to detect:
                <ul>
                    <li>Architectual flaws no defintion</li>
                    <li>poor design decisions  no defintion</li>
                    <li>Invalid or incorrect functionality</li>
                    <li>Security vulnerability no defintion</li>
                    <li>Scalabilitiy issues no defintion</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <ol>Testing best practices:
                <ul>
                    <li>Continous testing :enables software to be validated in realistic test environments earlier in the process  improving design and reducing rissk</li>
                    <li>configuration management:centrally maintain test assets and track what software builds to test </li>
                    <li>Servic virtualization:simulates the services and systems that are missing or not yet completed, enabling teams to reduce dependencies and test sooner. </li>
                    <li>Defect or "bug tracking:allow teams to track defects, measure their scope and impact, and uncover related issues </li>
                    <li>Metrics and reporting:Reporting and analytics enable team members to share status, goals and test results.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
