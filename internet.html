<h1>Operating Systems Terminology</h1>
    <ul> 
        <li>Network classifications: </li>
            <li> LAN :a collection of devices connected together in one physical location, such as a building, office, or home</li>
        
            <li> MAN:a computer network that connects computers within a metropolitan area</li>
        
            <li> WAN: a large computer network that connects groups of computers over large distances </li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
        <li> Network Models:</li>
            <li> bus network:  local area network (LAN) topology in which each node -- a workstation or other device -- is connected to a main cable or link called a bus</li>
        
            <li> star network: a local area network (LAN) topology in which all nodes -- personal computers (PCs), workstations or other devices -- are directly connected to a common central computer that is often referred to as a hub.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Protocols:</li>
            <li>CSMA/CD: a medium access control (MAC) method used most notably in early Ethernet technology for local area networking</li>
        
            <li> CSMA/CA: a protocol for carrier transmission in 802.11 networks</li>
     </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Combining Networks:</li>
            <li> Repater: a powerful network hardware device that regenerates an incoming signal from the sender before retransmitting it to the receiver</li>
    </ul>
