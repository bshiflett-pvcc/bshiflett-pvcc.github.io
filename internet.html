<h1>Network and Internet Terminology</h1>
    <ul> 
        <li>Network classifications: </li>
        
            <li> LAN :a collection of devices connected together in one physical location, such as a building, office, or home</li>
        
            <li> MAN:a computer network that connects computers within a metropolitan area</li>
        
            <li> WAN: a large computer network that connects groups of computers over large distances </li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
        <li> Network Models:</li>
        
            <li> bus network:  local area network (LAN) topology in which each node -- a workstation or other device -- is connected to a main cable or link called a bus</li>
        
            <li> star network: a local area network (LAN) topology in which all nodes -- personal computers (PCs), workstations or other devices -- are directly connected to a common central computer that is often referred to as a hub.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Protocols:</li>
        
            <li>CSMA/CD: a medium access control (MAC) method used most notably in early Ethernet technology for local area networking</li>
        
            <li> CSMA/CA: a protocol for carrier transmission in 802.11 networks</li>
     </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Combining Networks:</li>
        
            <li> Repeater: a powerful network hardware device that regenerates an incoming signal from the sender before retransmitting it to the receiver</li>

            <li> Bridge: a computer networking device that creates a single, aggregate network from multiple communication networks or network segments</li>

            <li> Switch: equipment that allows two or more IT devices, such as computers, to communicate with one another</li>

            <li> Router: a device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks</li>
        
            <li> Gateway: a device or node that connects disparate networks by translating communications from one protocol to another.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Client/ Server Model:</li>
        
            <li> P2P:  a group of computers are linked together with equal permissions and responsibilities for processing data</li>
        
            <li> Distributed Sytem: any environment where multiple computers or devices are working on a variety of tasks and components, all spread across a network.</li>
        
            <li> Cloud Computing: toring and accessing data and programs over the internet instead of your computer's hard drive</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Internet Addrtessing:</li>
        
        <li> Tier 1: an Internet Protocol (IP) network that can reach every other network on the Internet solely via settlement-free interconnection</li>

        <li> Tier 2: a service provider that utilizes a combination of paid transit via Tier 1 ISPs and peering with other Tier 2 ISPs to deliver Internet traffic to end customers through Tier 3 ISPs</li>

        <li> Tier 3: a provider that strictly purchases Internet transit</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul> 
        <li> IP Address:</li>
        
        <li>ICANN:<a href="https://www.icann.org/"></a></li>
        
        <li>DNS:turns domain names into IP addresses, which browsers use to load internet pages</li>
        
        <li> TLD: the last segment of a domain name, or the part that follows immediately after the "dot" symbol.</li>

        <li> Country-Code TLDS: <a href="https://www.worldstandards.eo.other/tlds/"></a></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li> Internet Protocolos:</li>
        
        <li> FTP: a standard network protocol used for the transfer of files from one host to another over a TCP-based network, such as the Internet</li>
        
        <li> HTTP: an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems that allows users to communicate data on the World Wide Web.</li>
        
        <li> SMTP: A messaging protocol governing electronic-mail transmission in Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) networks</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li> World Wide Web:</li>
            
        <li> URL: the mechanism used by browsers to retrieve any published resource on the web</li>
        
        <li> client side-activities:everything in a web application that is displayed or takes place on the client (end user device)</li>

        <li> server-side activities: activites that are carried out in response to client requests, and non-client-oriented operations such as maintenance tasks</li>

        <li> Network Layer: the part of the Internet communications process where these connections occur, by sending packets of data back and forth between different networks</li>
        
        <li> Link Layer: includes the protocols that define communication between local (on-link) network nodes which fulfill the purpose of maintaining link states between the local nodes</li>

        <li> Packet-Switching Network: transfers small pieces of data across various networks.</li>

        <li>Fault Tolerant:a process that enables an operating system to respond to a failure in hardware or software. </li>

        <li> Redundant:  the process of providing multiple paths for traffic so that data can keep flowing even in the event of a failure.</li>
    </ul>
